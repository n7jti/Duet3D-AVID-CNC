# Duet3D-AVID-CNC
Configuration for my Duet3D Avid CNC

This is the Duet3D configuration for my Desktop Standard Avid CNC.  I built the CNC in 2019 and this repository contains my current configuration files. When the CNC mechanically is the now discontinued Benchtop Standard 2432, the motion control is provided by a Duet 3 MB6HC board and a Pi4 SBC.  About once a year around the start of the holidays I upgrade to the lastest firmware, RPi OS, and the Duet Web Control.
